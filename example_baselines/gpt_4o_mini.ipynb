        "<!-- ## Task Introduction\n",
        "The goal of the task is to **develop a reliable text-to-SQL system on EHR**. Unlike standard text-to-SQL tasks, this system must handle all types of questions, including answerable and unanswerable ones with respect to the EHR database structure. For answerable questions, the system must accurately generate SQL queries. For unanswerable questions, the system must correctly identify them as such, thereby preventing incorrect SQL predictions for infeasible questions. The range of questions includes answerable queries about MIMIC-IV, covering topics such as patient demographics, vital signs, and specific disease survival rates ([EHRSQL](https://github.com/glee4810/EHRSQL)). Additionally, there are specially designed unanswerable questions intended to challenge the system. Successfully completing this task will result in the creation of a reliable question-answering system for EHRs, significantly improving the flexibility and efficiency of clinical knowledge exploration in hospitals. -->\n",
